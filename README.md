### "No Silver Bullet"
I am a backend engineer who firmly believes that **there is no silver bullet** in software engineering. I don't seek magical, one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, I embrace the inherent complexity of distributed systems and address it through disciplined architecture, automation, and deep observability.

My goal is to build resilient systems that don't just work, but remain maintainable and scalable under pressure. I prioritize understanding the "why" behind every technical decision, ensuring that every trade-off is calculated and every solution is grounded in engineering principles.
